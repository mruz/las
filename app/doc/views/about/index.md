Las is inspired by [LMS](http://lms.org.pl) and is designed for the needs of its author completely from scratch.

###### The following functionalities are provided at the time:
* clients managing,
* devices inventory (IP, MAC),
* tariffs with priorities and bandwidth limits,
* quality of service,
* redirections,
* messages to users,
* automatic payment schedule,
* multiple firewalls support (editable by web browser),
* automatic generating of firewalls,
* cutting indebted clients (redirecting traffic to one page),

Las won't replace administration skills. If you can't handle installation and configuration of your system, you likely won't manage to adjust Las for your system. In short - administration of UNIX systems is needed to operate this software.
